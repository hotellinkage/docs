# Booking Process

After checking availability with the finder component, guests begin a three-step booking process: room selection, payment, and confirmation. Each step takes place on a separate page with a specific component, without additional content, for an optimized booking experience.

## Process Steps

The booking flow consists of three pages:

- **[Room Selection](/booking-process/booking-rooms)** - Display available rooms and rates
- **[Checkout](/booking-process/booking-checkout)** - Collect guest information and payment  
- **[Confirmation](/booking-process/booking-confirmation)** - Show booking summary and details

## URL Structure

| Page | URL | Component |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Room Selection | `/booking-rooms` | `<rates>` |
| Checkout | `/booking-checkout` | `<checkout>` |
| Confirmation | `/booking-confirmation` | `<booking>` |

Each component is designed to work independently and should be placed on dedicated pages without extra content that could distract from the booking process.
