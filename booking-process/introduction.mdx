# Booking Process

Transform searches into confirmed bookings with our streamlined three-step process. Each step uses a dedicated component on its own page for a focused, conversion-optimized experience.

## The Booking Flow

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Room Selection" icon="bed" color="#0ea5e9" href="/booking-process/booking-rooms">
    Browse and choose from available rooms
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="2. Checkout" icon="credit-card" color="#10b981" href="/booking-process/booking-checkout">
    Enter guest details and payment
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="3. Confirmation" icon="thumbs-up" color="#8b5cf6" href="/booking-process/booking-confirmation">
    View booking details and reference
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Technical Setup

| Step | Page URL | Component | Purpose |
|:----:|----------|:---------:|---------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ | `/booking-rooms` | `<rates>` | Display available rooms |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ | `/booking-checkout` | `<checkout>` | Process payment |

<Warning>
üí° **Best Practice:** Keep each page dedicated to its component only. No headers, footers, or additional content that might distract from conversion.
