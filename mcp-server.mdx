The **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** enables Claude AI to access and understand Hotel Linkage documentation in real-time. Your development team can get instant answers, code examples, and implementation guidance directly from Claude.

<Note>
**What it does:** Transforms your Hotel Linkage documentation into AI-powered technical support | **Setup time:** 5 minutes
</Note>

## What is MCP Server?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that connects AI applications like Claude to external data sources. Our MCP server makes Hotel Linkage documentation **instantly accessible** to Claude AI.

**Real-world example:**

Developer asks: *"How do I add loyalty system to my hotel website?"*

Claude responds: *"To add Hotel Linkage loyalty system, you need 3 components..."*

### Multiple Team Members

Each team member can install the MCP server independently. All installations point to the same Hotel Linkage documentation source.

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Claude doesn't recognize Hotel Linkage" icon="question-circle">
    **Solution:** Restart Claude Desktop and ask specifically about "Hotel Linkage booking engine components"
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Installation command fails" icon="terminal">
    **Solution:** Ensure you have Node.js installed and try npm install -g @mintlify/mcp first
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Outdated responses" icon="refresh">
    **Solution:** MCP server automatically syncs with latest docs. Wait 5 minutes or restart Claude Desktop
  </Card>

## Getting More Value

**Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity:**

1. **Be Specific:** Ask "How do I implement Hotel Linkage finder in React?" instead of "How do I add search?"

2. **Context Matters:** Mention your tech stack: "Show me Hotel Linkage installation for Next.js project"

3. **Request Examples:** Always ask for "working code examples" to get implementation-ready snippets

4. **Follow Up:** Ask "Are there any common issues with this approach?" for troubleshooting tips
