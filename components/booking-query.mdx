description: "Component allowing users to access reservation details by entering identification credentials"
---

The `<bookingQuery>` component allows users to access the details of a specific reservation by entering their identification credentials. When integrated into a web page, this component displays a modal with two fields:

- Reservation identifier (bookingId)
- PIN code (pinCode)

If the entered data is valid, the user is automatically redirected to the reservation management page, where they can view the associated information. This component is ideal for sites that need to offer quick and secure access to reservations.

<Note>
**Component type:** Reservation lookup | **Fields required:** Booking ID + PIN code | **Redirects to:** Reservation management page
